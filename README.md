## Problem Description

Write a program that can take in a text file as input and output the line that is exactly in the middle when sorted. Implement your solution using Bash and Python. If the line has an even number of entries then it should output the line at floor(N/2), so the first of the two middle lines.

## Description of the Solution

(Organize this section however you see fit. For small assignments, a few bullet points or sentences would suffice. But for larger assignments, you should use different sections, links to sources, figures, etc. to convey how you have arrived at your final solution.)
